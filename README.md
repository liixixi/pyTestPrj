# pyTestPrj

This is my firt project in Github. I am a fresh.

This project will be python project, use VS2019 as python editor. I am also newer to python. python version should be large than 3? I am not sure.

I will implement a 3 layer auto testing engine, including:
1. execution engine, which allow to run configured test cases.
2. test case library, provide test cases and common workflow.
3. utilities, provide tools need by test case library.

Ok, after one day, I finish one json reader for python, which could load json object as python object, I don't know whether this is useful or not, let's see.
